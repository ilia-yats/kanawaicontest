`6` total files recently needed waiting on. This could be due to these files being large or a temporary transfer error. If this lasts longer than 24 hours then there may be a problem preventing these file(s) from sending. Make sure there are no non-ascii characters in the filename. Check the log for the file transfer on the Remote Destinations page by clicking the 'View recently sent files' button at the top then hovering the file and clicking 'View Log' on the right. Ignore this warning if all files are at 100% as it is old and should go away soon.<br><br><b>Files possibly being waited on (6):</b><br><div style='height: 60px; width: 50%; white-space: nowrap; overflow: scroll; background: #EFEFEF; padding: 6px; border-radius: 5px;'>/wp-content/themes/Zephyr/functions.php (0 send tries)<br>/wp-content/themes/Zephyr-child/functions.php (0 send tries)<br>/wp-content/themes/twentysixteen/functions.php (0 send tries)<br>/.git/HEAD (0 send tries)<br>/.git/config (0 send tries)<br>/.git/description (0 send tries)</div>
